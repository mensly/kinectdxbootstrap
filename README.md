This project makes it easy to start a new project with Kinect for Windows and DirectX. It uses the SharpDX DirectX toolkit, which has a similar API to XNA. It is designed to make it trivial to insert views of the camera and depth field during development, while still exposing all required data to the application in a common format across Kinect models.

To use this, start a new solution and add import this project. Your project will need to link against the SharpDX libraries (ideally through NuGet) as well as the Kinect for Windows v2 library. Linking against the Kinect for Windows v1.x library is not needed, as all the public components are exposed with v2 data types. If legacy support is not required, this library can be compiled without it by modifying the flags defined in its properties.
